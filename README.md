## General Information
- This is data science project that uses the historical loan data to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.
##Project Background
- You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
## Problem Statement
- Find the factors which can lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.
## Data set used
- The data set is a loan.csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.
